This folder contains a folder for each version of Xcode that Tunnelblick
can be built with.

Inside each of the folders is a Tunnelblick.xcodeproj.

To build using a particular version of Xcode, copy the appropriate
Tunnelblick.xcodeproj to the outer "tunnelblick" folder, replacing any existing
version.

That is, copy tunnelblick/xcodeproj-versions/XXX/Tunnelblick.xcodeproj to tunnelblick/

Do that by Option-dragging in Finder, or the the "cp" command with the "-R" option.
